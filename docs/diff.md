### Implement and integrate realtime features and functionalities to send and inject follow-up's into the agent context when the agent is running using the prompt input

Make it fully active when the agent is running.
This will allow the agent to have a more dynamic and responsive interaction with the user, as it can receive and process follow-up information in real-time. The agent can then use this information to adjust its responses and actions accordingly, providing a more personalized and effective experience for the user.
To implement and integrate realtime features for sending and injecting follow-up information into the agent context, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Follow-Up Structure**: Create a structure for the follow-up information that will be sent to the agent. This could include fields such as `followUpId`, `content`, `timestamp`, and any relevant metadata.
2. **Create a Real-Time Communication Channel**: Set up a communication channel (e.g., WebSocket, Server-Sent Events, or a real-time messaging service) that allows the client to send follow-up information to the agent in real-time.
3. **Integrate Follow-Up Handling in the Agent**: Modify the agent's processing logic to listen for incoming follow-up information through the communication channel. When a follow-up is received, the agent should inject this information into its context, allowing it to adjust its responses and actions based on the new data.
4. **Update the Agent's Response Logic**: Ensure that the agent's response logic can utilize the injected follow-up information effectively. This may involve updating the agent's decision-making algorithms to consider the new context provided by the follow-ups.
5. **Update the existing UI/UX and the prompt input to allow users to easily send follow-up information while interacting with the agent. de adding a dedicated input field for follow-ng follow-up options directly into the conversation interface, making it seamless for users to provide additional information or clarify their requests without disrupting the flow of the conversation.
6. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the implementation to ensure that the real-time follow-up functionality works as expected. This includes testing the communication channel, the agent's ability to process and utilize follow-up information, and the overall user experience.
