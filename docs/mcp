first search and research online for all the latest 2025 and 2026 docs and best practicies for implementing and integrating fully dynamic MCP server system into the current existing codebase and into the agent. 
- create ui/ux components and settings for it
- 
- Implement full context awareness
- wired everything together

First, Analyze the entire codebase and complete implementations and understanding the current state of the app's codebase and layout and UI/UX and design and styling and etc.       



Important Instructions and Guidelines:- 

 - Implement all the real functionalities and real features and real functions and real methods and real app layout and UI/UX and design and styling and etc instead of placeholders.

 - Keep the entire and complete codebase into Modular project Architecture codebase(NOT MONOLOG AT ALL): With Clean separation of concerns with utils, files, hooks, and components structure and etc... 

- Keep the complete codebase Refactored and consolidate the all the files and features and functionalities and files into smaller files properly.

IMPORTANT NOTE:- Always strictly and properly follow all the current complete existing architecture and patterns and best practices and implementations and structure and maintain existing styling everything else. Never remove current existing features and functionalities at all.







NOTE:- maintain the current existing Terminal/cli styling and designing and aesthetics without adding the $, - sings and etc...



Before creating any new files, check if there are existing files that already provide the same or similar functionality. If such files exist, update and enhance those existing files instead of creating duplicates. Specifically:

1. Before creating a new file, search the codebase to identify any existing files with overlapping functionality

2. If an existing file covers the same feature area, extend or modify that file rather than creating a new one

3. If you must create a new file, ensure it provides genuinely distinct functionality that doesn't duplicate existing capabilities

4. When updating existing files, preserve existing functionality while adding the new features
