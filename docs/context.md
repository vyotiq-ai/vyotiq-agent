## Launch multiple subagents for:-

- First,, check and analyze for all the incompletions and inconsistencies and bugs in the agent and the entire system
- make the agent highly precise and accurate and with fast smooth performance and really smooth user experience
- Improve the agent's task and planning creations and management system extremely good and accuaccurate
- Improve and fix the agents planning of the users query/tasks like an actual plan using all the latest 2025/2026 best practices only.
- make the agent and system extremely robust and bulletproof



Important Instructions and Guidelines:-
- Implement all the real functionalities and real features and real functions and real methods and real app layout and UI/UX and design and styling and etc instead of placeholders.
- Keep the entire and complete codebase into Modular project Architecture codebase(NOT MONOLITH AT ALL): With Clean separation of concerns with utils, files, hooks, and components structure and etc...
- Keep the complete codebase Refactored and consolidate the all the files and features and functionalities and files into smaller files properly.

IMPORTANT NOTE:- Always strictly and properly follow all the current complete existing architecture and patterns and best practices and implementations and structure and maintain existing styling everything else. Never remove current existing features and functionalities at all.

NOTE:- maintain the current existing Terminal/cli styling and designing and aesthetics without adding the $, - signs and etc...

Before creating any new files, check if there are existing files that already provide the same or similar functionality. If such files exist, update and enhance those existing files instead of creating duplicates. Specifically:

1. Before creating a new file, search the codebase to identify any existing files with overlapping functionality

2. If an existing file covers the same feature area, extend or modify that file rather than creating a new one

3. If you must create a new file, ensure it provides genuinely distinct functionality that doesn't duplicate existing capabilities

4. When updating existing files, preserve existing functionality while adding the new features
