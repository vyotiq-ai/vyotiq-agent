First, Analyze the entire codebase and complete implementations and architecture and understanding the current state of the app's codebase, agent, settings, system prompt and layout and UI/UX and design and styling and etc.

NOTE:- maintain the current existing Terminal/cli styling and designing and aesthetics without adding the $, - signs and etc...

## Launch multiple subagents for

we are not using the latest models for embedding and indexing at all. We are using a 2 year old model. Please search for the latest and best all rounder model from - https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=em and then complete replace from the current existing old model with it in the entire codebase properly.


## Important Instructions and Guidelines
- Implement all the real functionalities and real features and real functions and real methods and real app layout and UI/UX and design and styling and etc instead of placeholders.
- Keep the entire and complete codebase into Modular project Architecture codebase(NOT MONOLITH AT ALL): With Clean separation of concerns with utils, files, hooks, and components structure and etc...
- Keep the complete codebase Refactored and consolidate the all the files and features and functionalities and files into smaller files properly.

IMPORTANT NOTE:- Always strictly and properly follow all the current complete existing architecture and patterns and best practices and implementations and structure and maintain existing styling everything else. Never remove current existing features and functionalities at all.


Before creating any new files, check if there are existing files that already provide the same or similar functionality. If such files exist, update and enhance those existing files instead of creating duplicates. Specifically:
1. Before creating a new file, search the codebase to identify any existing files with overlapping functionality

2. If an existing file covers the same feature area, extend or modify that file rather than creating a new one

3. If you must create a new file, ensure it provides genuinely distinct functionality that doesn't duplicate existing capabilities

4. When updating existing files, preserve existing functionality while adding the new features to avoid breaking changes
